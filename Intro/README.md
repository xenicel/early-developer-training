# Into
In this lesson we will discuss the basics of html, css, and javaScript. The javaScript examples will demonstrate conditional logic, events and DOM manipulation.

There are three event listeners that are commented out, uncommenting them will activate a new feature.
* **document.addEventListener('click', moveElement)**   
  This will move the box to the location where you clicked
* **document.addEventListener('mousemove', makeLine);**  
  This will draw a line following your mouse movement
* **document.addEventListener('keydown', keydown)**  
  This will allow the screen to be cleared by pressing 'c'.   
  We can add new features here change the color or size of the line.
